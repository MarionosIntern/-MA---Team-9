## About Me
I'm a 20 year old junior with a major in computer science and a minor in math. I was born in cleveland,OH and moved to Charlotte in 2014. I love dancing, working out, playing videogames, listening to music, and watching anime. 

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to understand the field of computer science more and how to navigate through the professional space of sofware engineering. I hope this class allows to apply my skills and help develop new ones to push me towards becoming a full fledged sofware engineer. Whether its techincal or social skills, I hope I can take advantage of this oppturnity and learn more.
