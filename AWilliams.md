## About Me 
Hi I am a senior here at UNCG studying to get my computer science degree. I have always enjoyed technology and hope to use my knowledge to move the world forward. I am unsure what exact feild I want to enter into given there are many that I am interested in. But I am excited to continue to learn and complete my education.

## My CSC340 Goals 
What I hope to get out of this class is a lot of clarity and understand on software engineereing and how to go about handling different challenges when dealing with diffent projects. I also want to really understand the inter-workings of making websites/apps.
